Restroom in meadow, ample parking if there is no race on the waterfront (also easily accessible by transit). Most of the walk is flat, on mostly paved walkways, but there is one short steep descent to the waterfront. There are benches in the garden but nowhere else on the walk. Heavy rain cancels.",

The Pooch Coach will explain their body language, and how to read and understand it. We will get to see a wide variety of ways that dogs show their emotions.</p> <p>This will hopefully help people avoid confrontations in the future, and be better equipped to make judgments and decisions for their dog's and their own safety.</p> <p>In combination with this, The Pooch Coach will be demonstrating some self-defense moves for when aggressive dogs get too close, especially if they’re off leash.</p> <p>Please make sure and sign up for this, because we have to have at least 15 or 20 dogs to make it worthwhile.</p> <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THE LOCATION MIGHT CHANGE DUE TO A REMODEL OF THE PARK BEGINNING SOMETIME IN THE FALL/WINTER. WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED.<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p>",

Costumes encouraged for the Chihuahuas and the wonderful people who serve these little beasts!</p> <p>We will bring water and light snacks.</p> <p>As always, there will be dogs from local rescues looking for forever homes. We will send a follow-up email with the pics and bios. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell friends and families about these adorable creatures. They promise to fill their peoples' lives with love, laughs and life long adoration.</p> <p>PLEASE remember that Stern Grove is the home to many animals and among those are coyotes. We ask that you walk your dogs to the Meetup location on leash. And we ask that if you dog is a wanderer that you please keep him or her on leash. We want to make sure NO DOG goes into the hills. That is where the coyotes have their dens. Do not let your dog venture off.</p> ",

The Pooch Coach will explain their body language, and how to read and understand it. We will get to see a wide variety of ways that dogs show their emotions.</p> <p>This will hopefully help people avoid confrontations in the future, and be better equipped to make judgments and decisions for their dog's and their own safety.</p> <p>In combination with this, The Pooch Coach will be demonstrating some self-defense moves for when aggressive dogs get too close, especially if they’re off leash.</p> <p>Please make sure and sign up for this, because we have to have at least 15 or 20 dogs to make it worthwhile.</p> <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THE LOCATION MIGHT CHANGE DUE TO A REMODEL OF THE PARK BEGINNING SOMETIME IN THE FALL/WINTER.

    "description": "<p>We did this last year, and this is quickly becoming a new holiday tradition for our group. This will be our third year doing this hike and the views along this trail are absolutely breathtaking, and they always remind me of how much I love SF!</p> <p>This is a well traveled trail, and is easy to moderate in difficulty and is about 3.5 miles round trip. Dogs need to remain on leash on the trails.</p> <p>IMPORTANT NOTE:</p> <p>By RSVP'ing Yes for this event, you are agreeing to the following:</p> <p>1. Maintain oversight of your dogs and their welfare for the duration of the event.</p> <p>2. Keep your dogs on-leash for the duration of the hike.</p> <p>3.
